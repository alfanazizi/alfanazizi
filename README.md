 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Azizi's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, And all the while, teaching myself. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey -  I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to expand mycomfort-zone again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill my dream younger me had of building my own digital assets, my own digital assets. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content and blog-websites. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
